      "p1": "crypto-defi (“crypto-DeFi”) is an algorithmic-based money market system designed to bring a complete decentralized finance-based lending and credit system on to​ Multi Chain​ System. The difference of CDEFI from other money market protocols is the ability to use the collateral supplied to the market not only to borrow other assets but also to mint synthetic stable coins with over-collateralized positions that protect the protocol. These synthetic stable coins are not backed by a basket of fiat currencies but by a basket of cryptocurrencies.",
      "p2": "crypto-defi enables users to utilize their tokens by supplying collateral to the network that may be borrowed by pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a secure lending environment where the lender receives a compounded interest rate annually (APY) paid per block, while the borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed. These interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, where the rates are automated based on the demand of the specific market, such as Bitcoin.",
